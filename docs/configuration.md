# Configuration

Watchmaker is configured using a [YAML][0] file. Watchmaker's default
[config.yaml][1] file should work out-of-the-box for most systems and
environments. You can also use it as an example to create your own
configuration file. The default config file will install Salt and use the
bundled Salt formulas to harden the system according to the DISA STIG.

The configuration is a dictionary. The parent nodes (keys) are: `all`, `linux`,
or `windows`. The parent nodes contain a list of workers to execute, and each
worker contains parameters specific to that worker. The `all` node is applied
to every system, and `linux` and `windows` are applied only to their respective
systems.

You can create a file using the above format with your own set of standard
values and use that file for Watchmaker. Pass the CLI parameter `--config` to
point to that file.

## Config.yaml Parent Nodes

### all

Section for Worker configurations that affect the deployment of all platforms.
The `all` section will override parameters that are set in the OS-specific
sections of config.yaml.

### linux

Section for Worker configurations that should only be applied to Linux-based
systems.

### windows

Section for Worker configurations that should only be applied to Windows-based
systems.

## Config.yaml Worker Nodes

Watchmaker includes the _workers_ listed below. See the corresponding sections
for details on their configuration parameters.

*   [salt](#salt)
*   [yum (Linux-only)](#yum-linux-only)

### salt

Parameters supported by the Salt Worker:

-   `admin_groups` (_list_): The group(s) that you would like the admin accounts
    placed within.

-   `admin_users` (_list_): The user(s) that would be created as admins.

-   `computer_name` (_string_): The computer or hostname that should be applied.

-   `environment` (_string_): Set for the environment in which the system is
    being built.

-   `ou_path` (_string_): Specifies the full DN of the OU where the computer
    account will be created when joining a domain.

    ```yaml
    ou_path: "OU=Super Cool App,DC=example,DC=com"
    ```

-   `salt_states` (_string, comma-separated_): User-defined salt states to
    apply.

    ```yaml
    salt_states: foo,bar
    ```

-   `exclude_states` (_string, comma-separated_): States to exclude from
    execution of salt states.

-   `s3_source` (_boolean_): Use S3 utilities to retrieve content instead of
    http(s) utilities. For S3 utilities to work, the system must have boto
    credentials configured that allow access to the S3 bucket.

-   `user_formulas` (_dict_): Map of formula names and URLs to zip archives of
    salt formulas. These formulas will be downloaded, extracted, and added to
    the salt file roots. The zip archive must contain a top-level directory
    that, itself, contains the actual salt formula. To "overwrite" bundled
    submodule formulas, make sure the formula name matches the submodule name.

    ```yaml
    user_formulas:
      foo-formula: https://path/to/foo.zip
    ```

-   `salt_debug_log` (_string_): Path to the debug logfile that salt will write
    to.

-   `salt_content` (_string_): URL to the Salt content file that contains
    further configuration specific to the salt install.

-   `install_method` (_string_): (Linux-only) The method used to install Salt.
    Currently supports: `yum`, `git`

-   `bootstrap_source` (_string_): (Linux-only) URL to the salt bootstrap
    script. This is required if `install_method` is set to `git`.

-   `git_repo` (_string_): (Linux-only) URL to the salt git repo. This is
    required if `install_method` is set to `git`.

-   `salt_version` (_string_): (Linux-only) A git reference present in
    `git_repo`, such as a commit or a tag. If not specifid, the HEAD of the
    default branch will be used.
    `installer_url` (_string_): (Windows-only) URL to the Salt Minion installer
    for Windows.

### yum (linux-only)

Parameters supported by the Yum Worker:

-   `repo_map` (list of maps): There be dragons here! Please be careful making
    changes to the default config. Thoroughly test your configuration. The
    default config specifies yum repos that contain the salt-minion. If the
    default repos are not included, and the salt-minion is not available, the
    Salt Worker will fail. You can add repos here that you would like enabled,
    but be wary of removing the default repos. Each map must contain the
    following keys:

    -   `dist` (_list_): Distributions that would install this repo. Some repos
        are supported by multiple distros. (Currently supported distros are
        redhat, centos, and amazon.)
    -   `el_version` (`_string_`): The Enterprise Linux version for this repo,
        as in el6 or el7. Expected values are `'6'` or `'7'`.
    -   `url` (_string_): URL location of the repo file to be added to the
        system. This file will be copied to `/etc/yum.repos.d/`

    Example:

    ```yaml
    repo_map:
      - dist:
          - redhat
          - centos
        el_version: 6
        url: http://someplace.com/my.repo
    ```

        # where the formula will be placed. The <archive_url> must be a zip
        # file, and the zip must contain a top-level directory that, itself,
        # contains the actual salt formula. To "overwrite" submodule formulas,
        # make sure <formula_name> matches submodule names. E.g.:
